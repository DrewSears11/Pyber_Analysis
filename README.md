# Pyber_Analysis
Module 5 challenge

### 1. Overview of the Analysis - The purpose of this analysis is to look at the weekly fares categorized by city types to see how the differences may be used by decision-makers at Pyber

For example, near the end of February you can see it hits $2500 at one point for Urban, while it is below $500 for Rural during the same time frame.
This is because the number of rides in Urban areas was about 15 times greater than in Rural areas.  Urban cities was the lone of the three to actually
have more drivers than riders, which makes sense as you can see the drivers made the least amount of money, since there was less demand.
